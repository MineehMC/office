## Request to add a plugin on Poggit Release
I am writing to request that an old plugin be added onto Poggit Release. Details are as follows:

<!-- Please fill in the form under the "Value" column. You may leave the spaces or delete them. -->

#### Plugin Name
<!-- Add World Edit plugin pls -->



#### Link to GitHub repo
<!-- if any -->



#### Link to PocketMine Forums release
<!-- if any, link to the one on http://forums.pocketmine.net/plugins -->



#### Is it in the pre-Alpha_1.4 format?
<!-- "pre-Alpha_1.4" plugins can be understood as plugins that are released in a .php file instead of a .phar file -->



#### Does the plugin work in the latest PocketMine version?
<!-- Poggit does not support spoons. "latest PocketMine version" refers to the latest build from the master branch of https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP -->
<!-- Assume that the "api" in plugin.yml is already bumped when answering this question -->



#### Does the plugin depend on other plugins? Are they released on Poggit?
<!-- if any, please also specify links to their repos -->



#### Are the main authors still active?
<!-- If they are, please specify their contacts here -->
